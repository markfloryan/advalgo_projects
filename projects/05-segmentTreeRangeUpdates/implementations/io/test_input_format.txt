The format for the test case input is as follows:

LINE 1: contans an integer V ranging from 1-3 specifying the seg-tree variant this case tests, as follows:

1 -> tests the Addition + Get segtree
2 -> tests the Assign + Get segtree
3 -> tests the Addition + Max segtree



LINE 2: contains two integers, N and Q, specifying the size of the input array and the number of queries, respectively



LINE 3: contains the N integers, space separated, that are stored in the input array


The next Q lines will each contain a query of varying type based off of the value of V (specifying which segtree is being test) as follows:


V = 1 and 2:
Type 1: UPDATE L R X
Perform an update query with update-value X on range L-R

Type 2: GET P
Perform a get query at position P. The program should output the result of the query


V = 3:
Type 1: UPDATE L R X
Perform an update query with update-value X on range L-R

Type 2: MAX L R
Perform a max query on the range L-R. The program should output the result of the query.
